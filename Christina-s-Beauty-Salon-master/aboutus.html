							Christina's Beauty Salon and its staff have been a part of Columbias community for over 20 years. We value excellence in service and performance.
							Owner and stylist Yong first entered the business in 1995 through a shared space near the Columbia Mall. 
							After establishing roots in the community and enjoying offering styling services, Yong decided to create her own salon. 
							This was fully realized in 2000, when Yong opened Christina's Beauty Salon in downtown Columbia. In 2001, the salon was moved to its current location on Ash Street.
							Through its services, Christinas Beauty Salon offers a warm and comfortable environment for styling, coloring, and cutting hair.
